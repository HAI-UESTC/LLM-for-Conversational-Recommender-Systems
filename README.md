# Large Language Models for Conversational Recommender Systems: A Survey

A curated repository for our survey on **LLM-based conversational recommender systems (CRS)**.

This repository contains the manuscript source and a lightweight paper index organized from two complementary perspectives:

- **Application scenarios**: what role LLMs play in CRS
- **Technical paradigms**: how LLMs are integrated into CRS

The survey manuscript source is available in [`main_arxiv.tex`](./main_arxiv.tex).

## Overview

Conversational recommender systems aim to understand user needs through multi-turn interaction and provide grounded, personalized recommendations. With the introduction of large language models, CRS research has rapidly expanded from prompt-based interaction to retrieval grounding, fine-tuning, multi-agent planning, data construction, simulation, and trustworthy deployment.

To make this landscape easier to navigate, we organize the literature in this repository along:

- **6 application scenarios**
- **5 technical paradigms**

This README is intended as a quick entry point for readers, while the full survey provides a more systematic discussion.

## Application Scenarios

The following tables list the papers discussed under each application scenario in the survey.

- A paper may appear in multiple scenarios because one method can serve multiple roles in CRS.
- In this section, we keep only two columns as requested: `Method` and `Paper`.

## Reading Map

If you want a quick reading path through the literature, the following route works well:

1. Start with **User Modeling**, **Conversation Management**, and **External Knowledge Integration** to understand the online CRS pipeline.
2. Then read **Prompt Engineering**, **Fine-Tuning**, and **Retrieval-Enhanced Methods** to see the major implementation routes.
3. Finally, move to **Evaluation**, **Trustworthy Recommendation**, and **Agent-based Methods** for system-level concerns.
